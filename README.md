## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.

## Please Note: I've used Oracle SQL Developer and I've made changes in the schema.

## Table Creations

        CREATE TABLE 
                customer (
                customer_id Number PRIMARY KEY,
                Join_date TIMESTAMP
                        );


        CREATE TABLE menu (
                  product_id Number PRIMARY KEY,
                  product_name VARCHAR(50),
                  price INTEGER
                        );


        CREATE TABLE Sales (
                  customer_id Number,
                  order_date TIMESTAMP,
                  product_id Number,
                  FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customer (customer_id),
                  FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES menu(product_id)
                        );
