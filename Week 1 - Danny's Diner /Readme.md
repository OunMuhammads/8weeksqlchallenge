This case study is based on information from the following link: [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 

***
## Note: I've made some small tweaks to the database schema. I used MySQL, but feel free to apply the changes using your preferred tool.

## Table Creations

        CREATE TABLE 
            Members (
            customer_id int PRIMARY KEY,
            Join_date TIMESTAMP
                    );


    CREATE TABLE Menu (
              product_id int PRIMARY KEY,
              product_name VARCHAR(50),
              price INTEGER
                    );


    CREATE TABLE Sales (
              customer_id int,
              order_date TIMESTAMP,
              product_id int,
              FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES members (customer_id),
              FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES menu (product_id)
                    );
